# For Data Breachers 🏴‍☠️

*Standardized formats for the inevitable leaks*

Welcome to the resource center for those who will inevitably obtain EU age verification data. Since these databases are going to leak anyway, we might as well make the dumps consistent and easily comparable.

## 📋 What's Available

- **[Breach Data Schema](./breach-schema.json)** - Standardized JSON format for leaked datasets
- **[Common Database Structures](./database-samples/)** - Expected formats from different member states
- **[Data Classification Guide](./data-classification.md)** - What's actually valuable in these dumps
- **[Anonymization Failures](./anonymization-failures.md)** - How to spot terrible privacy protection attempts

## 🎯 Standardized Leak Format

Our schema provides consistent structure for:
- **Citizen Identity Data**: National IDs, passport numbers, biometric hashes
- **Verification Records**: Timestamps, IP addresses, device fingerprints  
- **Administrative Metadata**: Database versions, backup dates, access logs
- **Cross-Reference Tables**: Linking age verification to other government services

## ⚠️ Usage Guidelines

When you inevitably acquire this data:
1. **Use the standard schema** - Makes comparison across member states easier
2. **Include metadata** - Database versions, extraction dates, completeness indicators
3. **Document the source** - Which member state, which verification system
4. **Note the irony** - Government databases protecting children by surveilling everyone
