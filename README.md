*A standardized data breach schema for inevitable EU age verification failures*

## Overview

Welcome to Digital Papers Please - the proactive solution for WHEN (not if) each EU member state leaks their citizens' age verification data. Since mandatory identity verification is coming whether we like it or not, we're getting ahead of the curve by providing standardized schemas for the inevitable data breaches.

## Features

- **üìä Standardized Breach Schemas**: Uniform data formats for when (not if) government databases get compromised
- **üìã Compliance Failure Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for post-breach regulatory gymnastics
- **‚öñÔ∏è Legal Liability Distribution**: Handy charts showing who gets blamed when everything goes wrong
- **üîì Data Exposure Taxonomies**: Categorizing the creative ways sensitive information will be accidentally published

## What's Included

This repository provides:
- JSON schemas for standardized data breach notifications
- Templates for inevitable security incident reports
- Sample leaked database structures (for educational purposes)
- API specifications for post-breach citizen notification systems
- Compliance checklists for when everything inevitably goes wrong

## Mission Statement

*"Preparing for the inevitable with standardized schadenfreude"*

Since we can't stop governments from collecting sensitive data in the name of protecting children, we might as well make the resulting data breaches easier to understand and compare across member states.
